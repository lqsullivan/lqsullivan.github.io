A while back, a YouTuber I support on Patreon (shout-out to Practical Engineering) put up a video about surveyors and how to measure elevation. That got me reading about Total Stations, modern surveying equipment that uses gps and laser rangefinder readings to map terrain. I started thinking about golf rangefinders and got curious if I could start with a used one and work my way to a basic total station that can turn some button presses into a 3D terrain map.

So far this is turning into a sprawling, multidisciplinary project that is way out of my wheelhouse. I've finished a gaussian process to fit a surface to measured points, but I haven't worked on it much beyond that.
