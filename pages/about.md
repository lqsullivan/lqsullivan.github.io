I'm Logan, a statistician currently working for Medtronic. I got my masters in statistics from the University of Minnesota, and before that I spent some time in neurobiology research at Missouri State University.

Hopefully this site can keep some of my personal projects in order and serve as a kind of portfolio for potential employers.
 
Massive thanks to user sylhare for providing the [Type-on-Strap theme](https://github.io/sylhare/Type-on-Strap). I wasn't excited about github pages default themes, then I found out you can call out any custom theme hosted on github in the `_config.yml` and it'll use that instead.
