I'm Logan. Right now I'm a statistician at Medtronic. I got my masters in statistics from the University of Minnesota, and before that I spent some time doing neurobiology research at Missouri State University. If you want to know more about my academic and professional backgrounds, check out my LinkedIn (see footer).

In my spare time, I play ton of board games, read a bit, play clawhammer banjo, work through a backlog of movies, and try to document some of my other projects here.

## What's he doing here?

In the words of Tai Frasier from Clueless, "I dunno...stuff?"

I've got a bunch of projects that are unfinished and even more that are unstarted. Hopefully this can help me keep track of them and keep me motivated to do more work. I love reinventing wheels when I can; it always reminds me that wheels are hard and I don't understand them as well as I should. So, a lot of this blog will be me doing things that some great R library already does. That's ok. I spend all day at work building on other people's ideas and making progress, I can have different priorities here.

If the audience of these posts sometimes seems undecided, like I'm swinging wildly between statistics novices and experts, especially by over-explaining basic parts of content, that's because I'm kind of writing to myself (or at least myself 5 years ago). It reminds me of a time I had an assignment returned in grad school with a note about how I don't have to write justifications as basic as like 'linearity of expectation'. I didn't want to admit to the cool PhD student reviewing my work that the textbook's leaps in logic were sometimes too big for me and all those 'obvious' notes weren't so obvious to me.
 
## Anything else?

Massive thanks to user sylhare for providing the [Type-on-Strap theme](https://github.io/sylhare/Type-on-Strap). I wasn't excited about github pages default themes, then I found out you can call out any custom theme hosted on github in the `_config.yml` and it'll use that instead.
