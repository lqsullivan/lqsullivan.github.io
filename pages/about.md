I'm Logan. Right now I'm a statistician at Medtronic. I got my masters in statistics from the University of Minnesota, and before that I spent some time doing neurobiology research at Missouri State University. If you want to know more about my academic and profesional backgrounds, check out my Linkedin (see footer).

In my spare time, I play ton of board games, read a bit, play clawhammer banjo, and work through a backlog of movies. If you're interested in what I'm into right now, try An Infamous Traffic/The Great Zimbabwe/1830, Void Star/The Crying of Lot 49, Rob Stenson/Rhiannon Giddens/Steve Martin, and My Dinner with Andre/M/Prisoners.

## What's he doing here?

In the words of Tai Frasier from Clueless, "I dunno...stuff?"

I've got a bunch of projects that are unfinished and even more that are unstarted. Hopefully this can help me keep track of them and keep me motivated to do more work. I love reinventing wheels when I can; it always reminds me that wheels are hard and I don't understand them as well as I should. So, a lot of this blog will be me doing things that some great R library already does. That's ok. I spend all day at work building on other people's ideas and making progress, I can have different priorities here.
 
## Anything else?

Massive thanks to user sylhare for providing the [Type-on-Strap theme](https://github.io/sylhare/Type-on-Strap). I wasn't excited about github pages default themes, then I found out you can call out any custom theme hosted on github in the `_config.yml` and it'll use that instead.
